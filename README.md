# Numeral Systems

## By: josemanuelpr@ufps.edu.co

This is the implementation for the three activities in the PC Architecture course in college. 

The assignment consisted in the following:

1. Given a number in any of the following systems: Decimal, Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal, convert it to any of the others and execute basic operations like sum, subtraction, multiplication and division.
2. Given an amount of bytes (in units), represent them in either ISO or IEC representations (multiples of 10^x or 2^y). Also, given an amount in any of the standards, calculate the equivalence in other representations (e.g 12.3KiB to MB).
3. Given a number in decimal, represent it in the IEEE754 standard, show the sign, exponent and mantissa, and also the complete representation. Then, given a number in IEEE754 representation, show the sign, exponent, mantissa and number. Everything in 32 or 64 bits of precision.

The assignment also had to be done via implementing a GUI. The GUI has tabs for every functional requirement, but in order to be ran the instructions inside /lib/README.md have to be followed, since the .jar files are missing for JavaFX (it's just download them and extract the content inside the folder, the configs will do the rest if the program is ran in vscode).
